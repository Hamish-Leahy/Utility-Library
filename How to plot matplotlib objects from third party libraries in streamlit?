To plot Matplotlib objects from third-party libraries in Streamlit, you can use the `st.pyplot()` function provided by Streamlit. This function allows you to display Matplotlib figures directly within your Streamlit app.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
Make sure you have Streamlit and Matplotlib installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install streamlit matplotlib
```

2. **Import Libraries:**
In your Python script or Streamlit app file, import the required libraries:
```python
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

3. **Create the Matplotlib Figure:**
Use the third-party library to generate the Matplotlib figure. You can use any library that produces Matplotlib figures as output.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example: Generate a simple Matplotlib figure using NumPy
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Y-axis')
ax.set_title('Sine Wave')
```

4. **Display the Figure in Streamlit:**
Use the `st.pyplot()` function to display the Matplotlib figure within your Streamlit app.

```python
st.pyplot(fig)
```

5. **Run Your Streamlit App:**
Save your script and run your Streamlit app using the `streamlit run` command in your terminal or command prompt.

```bash
streamlit run your_app.py
```

Now, when you access your Streamlit app in a web browser, you should see the Matplotlib figure displayed on the page.

Note that `st.pyplot()` accepts a Matplotlib figure or any Matplotlib object (e.g., Axes, FigureCanvasTkAgg) as input. You can also use other Streamlit functions like `st.pyplot()` to display multiple plots, charts, or images in your app.

Make sure that you have only one `st.pyplot()` call in your Streamlit app, as multiple calls may not work as expected due to Streamlit limitations.

With this fix, you should be able to plot Matplotlib objects from third-party libraries in your Streamlit app successfully.
