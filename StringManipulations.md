1. **Camel Case Conversion:**
   Convert a string to camel case, where the first word starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter. For example, "hello world" becomes "helloWorld".

2. **Pascal Case Conversion:**
   Convert a string to Pascal case, where each word starts with an uppercase letter and there are no spaces. For example, "hello world" becomes "HelloWorld".

3. **Snake Case Conversion:**
   Convert a string to snake case, where words are separated by underscores. For example, "hello world" becomes "hello_world".

4. **Kebab Case Conversion:**
   Convert a string to kebab case, where words are separated by hyphens. For example, "hello world" becomes "hello-world".

5. **Title Case Conversion:**
   Convert a string to title case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized, and all other letters are lowercase. For example, "hello world" becomes "Hello World".

6. **Reverse String:**
   Reverse the characters in a string. For example, "hello" becomes "olleh".

7. **Truncate String:**
   Truncate a string to a specified length and add an ellipsis (...) at the end if it exceeds the limit. For example, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" becomes "Lorem ipsum dolor...".

8. **Count Occurrences:**
   Count the number of occurrences of a substring in a given string.

9. **Remove Whitespace:**
   Remove all whitespace characters from a string, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.

10. **String Padding:**
    Add padding to a string to make it a specific length. You can add padding to the left, right, or both sides of the string.

11. **String Compression:**
    Implement string compression techniques like Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to reduce the size of repetitive strings.

12. **Levenshtein Distance:**
    Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings, which represents the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into the other.

Remember to consider edge cases and thoroughly test each function to ensure their correctness and efficiency. Providing clear documentation and examples will also help users understand how to use these string manipulation functions effectively.
