Python is a great language for implementing algorithms thanks to its simple syntax, rich built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets, and extensive libraries. 
Some common algorithms that are easy to implement in Python include:

- Sorting algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort. These can be implemented recursively and by utilizing built-in methods like list.sort().

- Search algorithms like linear search and binary search on lists and dictionaries. Python's list comprehensions and high-order functions like filter() make these simple to write.

- Graph algorithms like depth-first search and breadth-first search using Python's dictionary and set data structures to represent nodes and edges. The queue module can be used for BFS.

- Dynamic programming algorithms like Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem etc can be written recursively with memoization to improve efficiency.

- Pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* algorithm which can find shortest paths efficiently even in large graphs. The heapq module is useful for Dijkstra's algorithm.

Some key Python features like list slicing, negative indexing, iterators/generators help write algorithms efficiently. Python's big standard 
library provides useful data structures and algorithms ready to use. Overall, Python makes an excellent choice to learn and implement common 
algorithms concisely and efficiently.
