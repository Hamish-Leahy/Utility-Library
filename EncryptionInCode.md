Here is a case study on using encryption in code:


The Need for Encryption

Ana is a web developer who recently launched an e-commerce site for her small business selling handmade crafts. The site requires customers to create an account and store payment information for future purchases. 

As the site grew, Ana became concerned about properly securing customer data. She realized she needed to encrypt all sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers. Without encryption, the data could be easily read if compromised.

Implementing Encryption

To add encryption, Ana took the following steps:

- She used bcrypt to encrypt all passwords in the database. Bcrypt hashes and salts passwords to protect them.

- Ana enabled SSL on the site to encrypt all traffic between the server and browser. This protected data sent over the internet.

- For storing credit cards, Ana used the AES encryption algorithm. AES provides strong encryption of sensitive financial data. 

- Ana ensured encryption keys were securely stored outside the codebase and rotated periodically. This prevented unauthorized access.

- The site was tested to validate all data was properly encrypted at rest and in transit.

Results of Encryption

Implementing encryption strengthened the security of Ana's e-commerce platform:

- Customer passwords and financial data were protected if the database was compromised.

- Users could verify the site used a valid SSL certificate, building trust. 

- Ana stayed compliant with industry data security standards.

- Encryption added minimal overhead to site performance.

Overall, adding encryption gave Ana peace of mind that she had safeguarded her customers' sensitive information. As the business continues growing, encryption will remain an integral part of the site's security defenses.
